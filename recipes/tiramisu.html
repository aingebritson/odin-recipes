        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            When a sweet tooth craving hits, sometimes the answer is a slice of classic tiramisu. It's the perfect end to any Italian dinner, moist and chewy and sweet. How can you say no?!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 C heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>8 oz mascarpone cheese</li>
                <li>1/3 C granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 t vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1.5 C cold espresso, prepared</li>
                <li>3 T Kahlua</li>
                <li>1 package lady fingers</li>
                <li>Cocoa powder</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Add whipping cream to a mixing bowl and beat on medium speed with electric mixers (or use a stand mixer). Slowly add sugar and vanilla and continue to beat until stiff peaks. Add mascarpone cheese and fold in until combined. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Add coffee and liqueur to a shallow bowl. Dip the lady fingers in the coffee (Don't soak them--just quickly dip them on both sides to get them wet) and lay them in a single layer on the bottom of an 8x8'' or similar size pan. </li>
                <li>Smooth half of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Add another layer of dipped lady fingers. Smooth remaining mascarpone cream over the top.</li>
                <li>Dust cocoa powder generously over the top (I use a fine mesh strainer to do this). Refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours or up to overnight before serving.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
